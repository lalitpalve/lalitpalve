title: Novel Vibrotactile Actuator
topics: Prosthesis & Orthosis, Haptics

blurb: Can we build a dense actuator grid to improve the perceptual intensity? Is there a minimum dimension which corresponds to how small we can go on this resoljution? if yes, what is it? These are some of the questions I am trying to answer through my project. The main goal of this project is also to build an actuator that can be used to provide tactile feedback to amputees who have undergone TMR surgery.

## Introduction
We can design materials to mitigate the effects of external forces and moments on our body due to interaction with daily objects. This is done partly by using geometrical contours like the shapes of handles, and by using smart mechanisms and materials. However, active wearable devices such as powered prostheses, exoskeletons, and haptic interfaces grounded to the human body lack appropriate design of interaction surfaces. The resulting buildup of forces and moments over the interaction surface between the human and the machine leads to decreased comfort and functional fit, and is a contributor to disuse of active wearable devices. This challenge is multi-faceted, and we approach it by addressing 4 major themes:
## Themes
 **Theme 1:** Human Measurement
We need to quantify the material behavior of the tissues of the body under loads applied at different points and directions.
 
 **Theme 2:** Design  
We need to design the ideal match between an engineered material and the human body to promote comfort and function.
 
 **Theme 3:** Instantiation  
We need to create tangible instances of the designed materials using commercial materials, and custom 3-D printed or cast structures.
 
 **Theme 4:** User Testing  
We need to get user feedback to validate the comfort of the candidate designs, and to quantify the behavior of the interaction between the human and machine system.

## Methods
The following must be accomplished

* Indentation experiments for 20 subjects to quantify the tissue biomechanical characteristics
* A design tool to specify material characteristics for the physical human robot interface material
* Jig design to test the effect of the instantiated physical human robot interface material
